// (frappe.ui.Sidebar.expand_parent_section), which is right while you are in
// it - but nothing closes the group again when you navigate out. So one visit
// to TaxJar API Logs leaves the group open for the rest of the browser tab,
// over every other page, until a full reload. That reads as "the group does not
// stay closed", because from the workspace page it looks exactly like an open
// group with nothing selected.
//
// This closes such a group again as soon as the route leaves it. A group the
// user opened by a click is left alone: the desk writes that click to
// localStorage under `section-breaks-state`, so an entry there means the user
// asked for this group's state and the app does not overrule it.
