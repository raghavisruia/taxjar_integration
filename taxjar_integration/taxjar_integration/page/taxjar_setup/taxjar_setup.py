"""Server APIs for the TaxJar guided setup desk page (/app/taxjar-setup).

Every endpoint is permission-guarded against TaxJar Settings and saves go through
doc.save(), so the doctype's own validate()/on_update (mode/credential checks,
field-visibility toggles, nexus auto-fetch) still fire — nothing here bypasses
the doctype's own rules, and nothing writes data the doctype itself can't.

Two child tables, two different lifecycles:

* TaxJar API Credential (table_hvjw) has no mandatory fields — a company can be
  added here (Connect step) before its accounts are known.
* TaxJar Company Config (company_config) requires both account heads, so a row
  can only be created once the Accounts step actually has them. Its two flags
  (taxjar_calculate_tax / taxjar_create_transactions) are edited by the
  Features step, on rows Accounts already created.

get_setup_state() therefore exposes ``credentials`` (from table_hvjw, drives the
Connect step) and ``companies`` (from company_config, drives Accounts/Features/
Review) as two separate lists rather than one merged shape.

``addresses`` is a third list with no child table behind it at all. The company
address TaxJar prices from is an ordinary ERPNext Address linked to the Company,
so it is read live per company - through the very same get_default_address()
the tax call itself uses - rather than mirrored into this doctype, where it
could disagree with what get_tax_data() will actually read.

# lookup resolves rather than a second opinion about it.

# What TaxJar needs from an address before it can price anything against it.
# Checked here rather than left to validate_address(): that hook only applies
# while taxjar_serves_any_company() holds, which is still false at this point in
# the wizard (the Features step has not run), so it is inert on exactly the
